# Live project status

## Current state

Milestone 0 is complete. Milestone 1 is locally verified on Linux for dependency locking, migrations, Django checks, authentication/session tests, static analysis, OpenAPI freshness, and source audits. Docker and hosted CI acceptance remain open. A small Milestone 3 iOS contract scaffold exists but has not been compiled. No production system has been contacted.

## Verified

- The workspace was empty, so no pre-existing user content was overwritten.
- The monorepo is a local Git repository on branch `main`.
- Architecture, trust boundaries, sync semantics, test categories, deployment separation, and stop conditions are documented.
- Current official documentation still supports the core Wallet-Shortcut/API bridge and warns that Tailscale CLI syntax is version-dependent.
- `uv.lock`, initial migrations, and the committed OpenAPI schema are reproducible and current.
- `make check` passes: 14 tests, 82.92% branch-aware coverage, Ruff, strict mypy, Django checks, and OpenAPI validation/freshness.
- Fresh-database migration checks, Django deployment checks with synthetic secrets, Bandit, `pip-audit`, YAML parsing, localization parity, whitespace checks, and a targeted secret scan pass locally.

## Not yet verified

- PostgreSQL/Redis/Celery/ASGI behavior under Docker.
- Swift/Xcode project generation, simulator build/tests, device archive, IPA packaging, signer, and physical-device behavior.
- GitHub Actions execution because no remote repository has been supplied.
- Ubuntu deployment, real Funnel hostname, backup restore, and external collaboration.

## Configuration still required later

- Final app name and bundle identifier.
- Repository remote.
- Actual public `*.ts.net` API URL.
- Production secrets and initial owner credentials supplied only at deployment.
